# EdgeAI Idea Spark: MIB Innovation Tool

An interactive web app to generate edge-AI business ideas, inspired by my ESP32 AI chat project and MIB's ethos of sparking innovation.

## Local Run Instructions
1. Clone: `git clone [https://github.com/Itsmeakash248/edgeai-idea-spark]`
2. Open `index.html` in browser. No setup—static JS magic!

## Design & Code Choices
- Semantic HTML for accessibility.
- CSS animations/media queries for intuitive, responsive UX (fade-ins for engagement).
- Vanilla JS with localStorage for functionality (randomized "AI" via templates—lightweight like embedded code; no external libs to keep it simple/original).
- Originality: Built from scratch, drawing on my AI passions. Used Gemini for brainstorming templates, but all logic/code is mine—explains edge computing tie-in for entrepreneurship.

## How It Works
- Input challenge → JS generates 3 ideas.
- Save/export for persistence/sharing.
Demo: Try "eco-friendly transport" for sparks!
